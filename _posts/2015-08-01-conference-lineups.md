[Marta Paciorkowska](http://twitter.com/a_meba) spoke today at
[Eurucamp 2015](http://2015.eurucamp.org/speakers/#marta-paciorkowska) about how
showmanship, comedy and egos are running wild at technology conferences. It was
a great talk and raised a lot of interesting points. I hope the video will be
online soon.

[Eurucamp](http://eurucamp.org) is certainly the best conference
I have ever attended in terms of diversity of speakers and attendees. The
organisers work hard to foster an atmosphere of friendship and inclusion. However,
I want to add to Marta's talk by mentioning something small that has been
bothering me about the way we discuss technology conferences in general.

> "That conference has a great lineup."

So much is implied by that phrase, so let's unpick it. To me, the following
conclusions can be drawn. One might:

1. Wish to attend a conference because the advertised speakers are well-known;
2. Choose not to attend a conference if the advertised speakers are not
   well-known;
3. Value the fame of the conference speakers over the content of the
   talks.

Whether for-profit or not, conferences all need enough revenue to break even and
a positive enough reception to justify future events. I have sympathy for the
organisers' feelings of financial liability. Inviting highly visible speakers
is one way of attracting attendees. But I have seen many
conference talks given by people who enjoy some level of fame
in technology circles. Some were great, some were average and some
were dull. In my experience, the hit rate has been largely the same for
speakers of whom I had previously never heard.

Some great steps have been made to encourage diversity at conferences already.
[Eurucamp has an anonymous process](https://cfp.eurucamp.org/guide).
The Ruby Manor organisers [wrote an entire web application](http://vestibule.rubymanor.org/the-vestibule-process)
to guide the conference content. As attendees, our job is to vote with our
money. Within our means, let's choose to attend the conferences with the most
interesting talks and the most diverse lineups. Let's reward the conferences
that promote ideas over heroes.
