Recent conversations on the topic of gender in software have had an unfortunate
trend. There seems to be a delusion that mere dialogue about gender bias and
related topics is somehow enough to taint the hacker culture. It is, of course,
already tainted.

The collective hacker ego is boosted by a belief that what hackers do has the power
to change the world. The "change the world with code" meme has been floating
around for years, reinforced in recent years by puffed-up recruitment pitches
from aspiring business owners and venture capitalists.

Consequently hackers gained a wild overconfidence in their
own abilities. To reason about business problems and describe them in code is to
change the world! It follows that every real problem must be solvable by
hackers. What's more, anything that is outside the life experience of these
legendary giants of intellect is treated with suspicion and disdain.

Conversations about [innate ability][hnnatural] and gender
differences meander, but they always arrive at a variation on
the same point. Somebody [refutes the subject entirely][hnstereotype]. So often
this actually feels like a desperate plea for the boat not to be rocked.
*Please stop mentioning unpleasant things. The status quo works for me.*

Hacker culture is [famously][sharp] ill-equipped to [deal][adria] with
[social problems][nexxy]. When issues stemming from sexism arise, denial is the
most common reaction. Emotional literacy is nowhere to be found.

The next big problem that hackers must solve is not one of data analysis or
logic. It won't be solved through inferential statistics or
[hunting for logical fallacies][baloney]. It is the lack of empathy endemic in
their culture. As long as every difficult conversation is dominated by
disbelief, people will continue to be driven away.
