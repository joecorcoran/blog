I've moved my personal site and email address from an .io domain to .online.

It took me too long to do this. I even toyed with the justification that practically
all top-level domains are absurd in their reinforcement of border politics in a
virtual space, and [corrupt in their administration][icann], but in the case of .io, it's much worse.

The British Indian Ocean Territory, to which the .io TLD is assigned, was formerly known
as the Chagos Islands. The Chagossians continue to [fight for their right to repatriate][fight]
decades after being brutally removed from their homes by the UK government, who annexed the islands shortly
before Mauritian independence.

The Chagossians, now scattered around the world, see none of the profit from the sale of
.io TLDs. [The UK denies making money from them too][lords]:

Popular with tech startups (due the double meaning of input/output), .io TLDs cost [around $40 per
year (USD)][dnsimple] and clearly, that money is going somewhere. Hopefully the recent [vote at the UN general assembly][un]
in favour of seeking an advisory ruling from the International Court of Justice
is the first step towards the Chagossians returning home, and .io profits being redistributed
to Mauritius for use in rebuilding the islands for non-military habitation.
