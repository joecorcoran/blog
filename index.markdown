# Hello!

I'm a software developer, mostly working on web applications. I have spent most of my life so far in Manchester and London, UK, but I currently live in Berlin, Germany where I work at [tape.tv](http://tape.tv).

I write and maintain some [open source software](/projects) and I sometimes [write about software development and people](/articles). I'm also a coach at [Ruby Monstas](http://rubymonstas.org/), which is a weekly [Rails Girls Berlin](http://railsgirlsberlin.de/) study group.

I'm interested in programming languages, music, sport and design. When I'm not thinking about that stuff you will often find me playing football, riding a bike or cooking vegetarian food.

You can [write to me](mailto:joe@corcoran.io) or [shout at me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/josephcorcoran).
