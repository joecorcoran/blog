I'm a web application developer and I live in Berlin, Germany.

I'm currently working on a new music video discovery platform at [tape.tv](http://next.tape.tv). I write and maintain a bunch of [open source software projects](/projects) and I sometimes [write about programming](/articles) too.

I'm interested in programming languages, music, colour science, and interface design. When I'm not thinking about that stuff you will often find me playing football or riding a bike.
