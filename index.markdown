I'm a software developer. I grew up in Manchester, England and lived for a long time afterwards in London. Now I live in Berlin, Germany.

I currently work at [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com). I write and maintain a few [software projects](/projects) and I sometimes [write about software and people](/articles). I was formerly a regular coach at [Ruby Monstas](http://rubymonstas.org/), which is a weekly [Rails Girls Berlin](http://railsgirlsberlin.de/) study group.

You can [write to me](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or [shout at me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/josephcorcoran).
