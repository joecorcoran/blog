I'm a web application developer and I live in Berlin, Germany.

I'm interested in programming languages, colour science, and interface design. When I'm not thinking about that stuff you can often find me wearing headphones, kicking balls or pushing pedals.

You can contact me by [email](mailto:joecorcoran@gmail.com) or on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/josephcorcoran). I can be found in lots of other places too, including:
