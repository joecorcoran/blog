I'm a web application developer and I live in London, UK. I currently build things with Ruby and JavaScript at [Tribesports](http://tribesports.com). You can see [my open-source work on GitHub](http://github.com/joecorcoran).

I'm interested in programming languages, colour science, and interface design. When I'm not thinking about that stuff you can often find me wearing headphones, kicking balls or pushing pedals.

You can contact me by [email](mailto:joecorcoran@gmail.com) or on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/josephcorcoran). I can also be found in the following places:
