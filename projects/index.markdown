# Pannier

A general-purpose Ruby asset processing tool. Intended as an asset pipeline replacement that can be used in any Rack environment. Work in progress.

# Judge

Judge allows easy client side form validation in Rails 3, by porting many `ActiveModel::Validation` features to JavaScript and exposing your model validations as JSON within HTML5 data attributes. It eliminates the need for code duplication or gratuitous AJAX for standard Rails validators. Where possible, it also provides an interface for adding application-specific validators to both sides of the network.

* [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/judge)

# Hideable

A Rubygem that provides an `ActiveRecord` mixin for hiding records without overriding any standard behaviour. Often when dealing with user-generated content, hiding a record is better than deleting it.

* [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/hideable)

# SemanticVersioning

A Rubygem for working with software version numbers as specified by [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0-rc.1](http://semver.org/). It passes every example given in the specification to date and is not tied to Rake, nor any particular task involving versioning. Plain old Ruby objects.

* [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/semantic_versioning)

# Backbone.ScopedCollection

An experiment in adding chainable functions to [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) collections.
