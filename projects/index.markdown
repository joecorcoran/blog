# Fabrik

An implementation of traits for use in for Ruby 2. Fabrik provides traits that
can be "flattened" into classes without affecting inheritance,
as described in [Traits: A Mechanism for
Fine-grained Reuse](http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Duca06bTOPLASTraits.pdf).

# Pannier

A general-purpose Ruby asset processing tool. Intended as both a command line tool for static sites and an asset pipeline replacement that can be used within any Rack application.

* [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/pannier)

# Judge

Judge allows easy client side form validation in Rails 3, by porting many `ActiveModel::Validation` features to JavaScript and exposing your model validations as JSON within HTML5 data attributes. It eliminates the need for code duplication or gratuitous AJAX for standard Rails validators. It also provides an interface for adding application-specific validators to both client and server where necessary.

# Telepad

A Music Hack Day London 2013 project. Allows the user to make calls and play sounds to eight telephones from a Novation Launchpad.

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/telepad)

# Cities

A Ruby interface to the free [database of world city data](http://www.maxmind.com/en/worldcities) from MaxMind. Provides information like latitude, longitude and population for every city in the world. The data was munged to JSON and is provided as a tar file external to the gem.

* [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/cities)

# Hideable

A Rubygem that provides an `ActiveRecord` mixin for hiding records without overriding any standard behaviour. Often when dealing with user-generated content, hiding a record is better than deleting it.

* [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/hideable)

# SemanticVersioning

A Rubygem for working with software version numbers as specified by [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0-rc.1](http://semver.org/). It passes every example given in the specification to date and is not tied to Rake, nor any particular task involving versioning. Plain old Ruby objects.

* [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/semantic_versioning)

# Backbone.ScopedCollection

An experiment in adding chainable functions to [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) collections.
